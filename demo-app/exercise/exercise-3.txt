1. Create an array of two cars objects using the car data from the hard coded table. Define the array within the Car Tool component.

Note: Do NOT create an array of arrays and do not create 6 arrays (one for each car property)

2. Update the car table to be dynamically created from the array of cars.

3. Ensure it works with no errors in the console.
